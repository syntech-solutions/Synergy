OpenAi key has been removed for security reasons (provide your own key to use the brainBoard).
The free socket server shutdown every 24 hours and have to be manually started, therefore the calling features in the app will not be functional
the socket servers are provided and can be manually hosted but will need to be connected to by changing the server url in the code.

To run the project 
1. run 'npm install --force' in the synergy-app folder locally host the app using 'npm run dev'
2. run 'npm install' in the synergy-calling folder locally host the app using 'npm run dev'
3. run and host the servers if needed
